<big><i><b>The scene layout</b></i></big><br>
<br>
The intended result is a plain with a few mesa-style hills
in the background. The camera is near the ground level. The foreground
is deep and flat, to enhance the plain effect.<br>
<br>
One height field and one ground plane with a sand texture are
sufficient, apart from the sky with a very few clouds. We simulate dust
with a very light fog, the same color as the sand.<br>

This tutorial uses the <i>desert.pov</i> scene provided with Geomorph
0.12 and higher. As a reminder, you click on <img alt=""

than the default one.<br>

Create a new subdivision 2 document.<br>

would give "sparse" peaks.<br>
      <br>
Hit the refresh button until you get a few peaks grouped somewhere, or
simply copy the seed given in the example.<br>
      <br>
It's not important if the peaks are not at the right place for now,
we'll translate them later. What's important is that they are
grouped in a relatively small part of the image, so that we can
transform
the rest of the HF in a wide plain - our foreground.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <img src="../light.jpg" alt="" align="left" height="42" width="42">When
"distribution" is set to 1, any surface displacement (peak or
hole) has the same probability. When "distribution" is higher,
important displacements become less frequent, so "holes" or "peaks"
seem "sparse". <br>
      <br>
      <img src="../question.jpg" alt="" align="left" height="41"
 width="42"> The distribution is an exponent, as seen in this formula,
given that RD is the calculated random displacement and varies between
0 and MAX :<br>
      <blockquote>&nbsp;<big><tt><small>ACTUAL_DISPLACEMENT = power
(RD/MAX ; DISTRIBUTION) x MAX</small></tt></big>;</blockquote>
Note that MAX depends on the scale, which depends on the subdivision
step. Actually MAX is divided by 2 at each step.<br>

the terrain</b> <br>
      <br>
The purpose is to decrease the lower parts of the terrain, so that we
get peaks on a plain.
      <div align="center">
      <div align="left"><img src="tools_step2.jpg" alt="" align="left"
 height="421" width="255"> <br>
You can use the default parameters of the power transformation here. It
raises each pixel height to its square (the "Parameter" is the
exponent), then "clamp" the values so that they fit in the height field
range (0-65535).&nbsp; If the surroundings of the peaks seem dark
enough, accept the result. Otherwise, click "Reset" and try with 3 or a
higher value. With a high exponent, the ground flattens and looses all
details, if it is what you want.</div>
      <div align="left"><br>
      <img src="../light.jpg" alt="" align="left" height="42" width="42">Hitting
"Apply", then "Repeat" with an exponent of 2 is the
same as "Apply" with an exponent of 4. Hitting "Repeat" twice with
an exponent of 2 (after "Apply") an exponent of 8. It's multiplicative,
not additive. Hitting "Apply" twice only reapply the same exponent to
the original image, unless you accept the result after the first click.<br>

      <td valign="top"><b>3. Translating the terrain</b><br>
      <br>
We want to put the camera at the bottom center (South), looking towards
the top center (North). It would be nicer with peaks centered West-East
and moved North, in the background, so that the plain can be seen.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="left"><img src="tools_step3.jpg" alt="" align="left"
 height="290" width="215"> </div>
      <img src="../../tut_moon/light.jpg" alt="" align="left"
 height="42" width="42"> The "Translate" transformation is based on an
interesting property of all height fields created with the subdivision
and the surface addition algorithms of Geomorph: terrains "wrap", so
that it is possible to tile them on a greater surface. It is also
possible to apply them as a normal on a cylinder or on a torus
seamlessly, if your can find a purpose for this. The West side "fits"
with the East side, and so does the North one with the South one.<br>
      <br>
So, translating our image 15% East centers the peaks, and translating
it 15% North put the peaks in the background.<br>
      <br>
In version 0.12, the document display "flickers" when you accept the
translation. Although this could be annoying, it doesn't affect
the result.<br>

      <td valign="top"><b>4a. Stratifying the peaks</b><br>
      <br>
We want mesa-style hills, so we'll use the "Terraces" transformation to
stratify the peaks.<br>
      <br>
The stratification is a 3-step process, although the result
is usable after the first step:<br>
(1) Quantizing.<br>
(2) Smoothing and removing unwanted noise<br>
(3) Merging with the original image.<br>
      <br>
We'll discuss merging in point 4b.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="tools_step4a.jpg" alt="" align="left" height="676"
 width="234"> A mesa has a very few altitude levels, unlike terraces
used
for agriculture. Let's choose 4 levels.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="../../tut_moon/question.jpg" alt="" align="left"
 height="41" width="42"> The stratification groups the 65536 possible
altitude levels into the number of levels given by the user. Suppose
that the height field values range from 10000 to 50000, here there
would be 4 levels of 10000, the first one with resulting value 0,
grouping all values between 0 and 9999, the
second one with resulting value 10000, grouping values between 10000
and
19999, and so on.<br>
      <br>
The basic process creates levels of equal height. This could be boring.
The random variation parameter alleviates this. The default value is
50% of the height of each level. Let's keep the default parameter. It
can be read as "displace the altitude of the current level by a random
value between 0% and 50% of the calculated difference between levels".<br>
      <br>
If you are not satisfied with the altitude of some levels, for instance
if there are too many "needles" or narrow peaks, hit "Refesh" at will.
The height of each level would vary, and so their surface, as long as
your random variation parameter is not null.<br>
      <br>
Click on the left arrow under "post-processing" to get the "smoothing"
and "artifact removal' controls.<br>
      <br>
Smoothing gives a more natural look. A radius of 2 here is enough,
because we'll want to mix the result with the orginal, and to erode
it with rain.<br>
      <br>
Use "Artifact removal" if your image contains annoying spots ("needles"
when rendered), and if you cannot get rid of them by refreshing the
random seed. It is in pixels. For a given effect, the radius should be
proportional to the size of the image, so that 10 for a 512x512 image
is equal to 20 for a 1024x1024 image.<br>
      <br>
Post-processing is expensive, so it is not immediate. To see the
result, you must click "Apply", and wait.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="../light.jpg" alt="" align="left" height="42" width="42">Note
that if you change the quantization levels, the random
variation or the random seed, after post-processing the image, you
must reapply the post-process.<br>

 width="238"> The preview shows a pretty boring flat plain around the
hills. Rendering the <i>desert.pov </i>scene is worse (actually, the
height field ground would probably disappear under the sand plane).<br>
      <br>
The last subdialog of the terraces options allows you to mix the source
and the result in variable proportions.<br>
      <br>
It will restore some detail on the ground, while smoothing the edges of
the terraces.<br>
      <br>
Click on the left arrow to display the dialog (if you don't
have a huge desktop, you would probably hide the post-processing dialog
by clicking on its right arrow).<br>
      <br>
The default "Mode" = "+" is correct for our purpose. The default "Mix"
is 100% result, 0% source. Click on the "0" button at the right for
mixing the source and the result in equal proportions. This is the
ratio used for this tutorial. You can try different proportions.<br>

You can render the scene now by clicking <img

 alt="the &quot;Povray with file choice&quot; icon" height="28" width="28"> and
choosing <i>desert.pov</i>. If you want to compare with the final
result <a href="#Desert_scene">showed above</a>, set the camera
parameters as shown in step 6. It's already interesting, but we can
give it a more natural look with water erosion.<br>

 width="216"> The erosion must be light. We don't want to totally
destroy the terraces edges. For a 512x512 image, you could try 25000
drops.<br>
      <br>
Render it, and if you are not satisfied, change the number of drops and
hit "Apply". If you haven't clicked "Accept", it would reapply the
drops to the uneroded height field.<br>
      <br>
If you only want to add drops, set the quantity to add and hit
"Repeat". You avoid recomputing 25000 drops!<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="../light.jpg" align="left" height="42" width="42">25000
drops in a 512x512 image are equivalent to 6250 drops in a
256x256 image, or 100000 drops in a 1024x1024 image. It is proportional
to the surface, which increases like the square of the linear size.<br>

      <br>
The <i>desert.pov</i> scene from Geomorph 0.12 and higher is
coupled with the preview camera.<br>
      <br>
The final result <a href="#Desert_scene">shown above</a> is obtained
with the parameters given at right.<br>
      <br>
Remember than the parameters are saved with the PNG height field. Here,
the first camera is used. The other cameras keep the default settings,
as used in steps 1 to 5 of this tutorial.<br>
      <br>
Maybe you'll find that your rendered image needs some tuning. Look at <i>desert.pov</i>
in your prefered editor. The parameters that you are likely to change
are grouped at the bottom of the file, under a line of "*".<br>
      <br>
For this scene:<br>
      <ol>
        <li> I decreased slightly the height field vertical scale (Y
axis). You can also get it by using the brightness / contrast tool
in Geomorph.</li>
        <li> I adjusted the relative position of the height field and
the sand plane, so that the sand plane is not totally hidden by the
height field in the foreground, and the height field is not totally
hidden by the plane. It's more interesting when spots of sand are seen
among
spot of rocks. Very small move of the height field or the sand plane
modify
a lot the final look.</li>
        <li> I scaled down the sand texture a lot, by scaling down the
plane. It's an infinite plane, only its texture reacts to scaling.</li>
        <li> I played a lot with the fog parameters, just above
the line of "*". Fog is dust here, so it should be light.</li>
