<big><i><b>The scene layout</b></i></big><br>
<br>
The intended result is an imaginary moon, moving around an imaginary
planet with no visible atmosphere. On the planet there is
an ocean of some reflective liquid, which seems to have eroded the
terrain (so there should be some atmosphere, shouldn't it?). Well, it's
simpler to look at the result.<br>
<br>
The center of interest is the moon and its craters. Reflection of the
moon on the ocean increases the impact. So, we need a cleared area
centered along the eye axis, in which the reflection would be visible.
Furthermore, the cleared area can behave like a path driving the eye
towards the moon. This cleared area would be given by a valley-like
height
field.<br>
<br>
The moon is a sphere, over which we map a Geomorph height field acting
like a normal. In Povray language, this is a "bump map normal".<br>
<br>
The light is dimmed, giving a night effect.<br>

This tutorial is divided in two parts, one for <a
 href="#A._Building_the_moon">building the moon</a>, the other for <a
 href="#B._Creating_the_final_scene">rendering the final scene</a>.<br>
<br>
The moon part uses the <i>moon.pov</i> scene, the final scene
is rendered with <i>sea_n_moon.pov.</i>&nbsp; Both are provided with
Geomorph 0.12 and higher.<br>

Hit "Repeat" until you have enough craters for your taste.<br>
      <br>
If you hit "Apply" more than once, you'll only replace the 10 craters
you have just drawn with 10 different craters.<br>
      <br>
One important parameter in the "Diameter" subdialog is the
distribution. This is, roughly, the exponent to the crater diameter,
chosen randomly. At 1, all craters sizes between "Boundary 1" and
"Boundary 2" have the same probability of being chosen. The
distribution of diameters is uniform.<br>
      <br>
The default is 2. In this case, the distribution of diameters shows a
quadratic curve. There are more small craters, and less huge ones.<br>
      <br>
For getting enough small craters here, 8 was used.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="../question.jpg" alt="" align="left" height="41"

GD = generated diameter, in pixels (from random seed, uniformly
distributed)<br>
RD = resulting diameter, in pixels<br>
B1, B2 = boundaries 1 and 2, in pixels<br>
E = exponent<br>
We normalize the difference between GD and B1, relatively to B2-B1, so
that the difference fits between 0 and 1, apply the exponent to this
value, then multiply the result by B2-B1 to reconstitute a value in
pixels:<br>
RD = [ power( (GD-B1)/(B2-B1), E) x (GD-B1) ] + B1<br>

used. Under Povray 3.5, this gives an ugly stretched result, so a
"planar" map type is used. The map seems to be applied perpendicular to
the Z axis (the foreground to background axis, with the default
Geomorph camera). When the camera is rotated around the Y axis (the
bottom to top axis), the moon must be
rotated too, otherwise the map is warped on the edges. <i>sea_n_moon.pov</i>
manages this, and you'll have to care about this if you reuse this code
in other scenes. I would welcome any advice about this mapping question.<br>

      <br>
A height field with a huge valley can be created in two ways: &nbsp;by
using the "height field pen" for digging the valley in a relatively
smooth height field, or by using the random generator until we get a
valley.<br>
      <br>

the random generator, clicking repeadly on the "Refresh" button
(actually 15 times). The distribution parameter was set to a high
value, to increase the probability of getting a large cleared area. See
      <a href="../../tut_desert/en/The_Desert_Tutorial.html">the desert
tutorial</a> for an explanation about the distribution parameter.<br>
      <br>
We set the camera parameters so that the valley becomes parallel to the

approximately were is the camera.<br>

      <div align="left"><img src="tools3b.jpg" alt="" align="left"
 height="599" width="236"> </div>
A realistic eroded terrain shows "ribs". The rain erosion provided with
Geomorph gives a surface with delicate channels or gutters, which
doesn't show a "ribs" effect. We can approximate "ribs" before applying
the rain erosion, with the "whimsical erosion".<br>
      <br>
You can use the default settings.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="../light.jpg" alt="" align="left" height="42" width="42">
You should adjust the radius and the rib smoothing radius to your image
size. The defaults of 6 and 2 for a 512x512 image translate as
3 and 1 for a 256x256 image, 12 and 4 for a 1024x1024 image, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="../question.jpg" alt="" align="left" height="41"
 width="42"> This process has nothing to do with erosion, except some
likelihood. It was discovered more or less by chance or at random, when
experimenting with slope maps. The name is a translation of the French
word "fantaisiste", which means something like "funny" and "weird" (as
"whimsical" can mean, as I understand), but never "fanciful" or
"capricious" (as "whimsical"
does mean). But if you play with it a bit, maybe you'll find that it
fully
deserves the "whimsical" adjective... Nevertheless I would consider any
interesting suggestion about this name.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="../light.jpg" alt="" align="left" height="42" width="42">
Hint: on the weird side, use a radius like 20 for a 512x512 image,
slide the "Mix" scale towards the "Result", then increase the contrast
with the brightness / contrast tool. If you find a use for the result,
drop me a mail!<br>

The contrast of the image is too weak, we don't even bother to render

valley ground which is black or almost black.<br>

It's preferable that you click on the "Accept" button in all tools,
instead of relying on the auto-accept feature, at least as long
Geomorph is in an alpha or a beta phase. Inconsistencies were observed
when a new document is opened or created and the last transformation
was not committed.<br>

The rain erosion is a simple but slow process. It drops randomly water
on the ground, and move soil down the slope until the slope is too low.
It doesn't add up drops to build creeks and rivers (not yet!).<br>
      <br>
Here 300000 drops were thrown on the ground. Maybe you'll be happy with
less (particularly if your computer is slow!). Hit the "Repeat" button
three times to get this result.<br>
      <br>
Remember that we started from an image of 512x512 pixels. For a 256x256
image, 75000 drops would give the same result. For a 1024x1024 image,
you'll have to use 4 x 300000 drops.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="../light.jpg" alt="" align="left" height="42" width="42">
Hitting "Repeat" once is the same as hitting "Apply", but hitting
"Apply" repeatedly never gives more than 100000 drops, since it reuses
the original image as input.<br>
      <br>
The rendered image is more natural now. However, we could get a
smoother image with the "Crests" tool.<br>

The "Crests" tool implements a kind of "gravity erosion", or
micro-subsidence. Parts of the soil fell on parts of lower altitude.
Crests emerge where the slope is null and the height at its maximum.<br>
      <br>
Contrarily to the rain erosion, this transformation involves a soil
loss, so the average height of the terrain decreases a bit.<br>
      <br>
Set the steps at will, reset if you are not satisfied.<br>

The 3 erosion tools and the order in which they were used here
(whimsical - rain - crests) are not compulsory. Variations on this
sequence can also
give interesting results.<br>

The <a href="#Final_result">proposed image</a>, at the beginning of

shore at the entrance of the cove obtained after step 6 would close the
cove. The log transformation allows this. It raises the lower parts of
the height field without raising the highest hills, while the deepest
parts remain black (think about the log curve to get the figure).<br>
      <br>
The parameter is interpreted as a percentage. Using 0,5, over a maximum
of 10, means that we merge 5% of the resulting log transformation with
95% of the original image. 0,5 or so is enough here, except if you want
another effect.<br>
